# Time2Code
This is my first COMP1511 assignment, this is also my first coding project.
In this assignment I need to get the local time of the given down only using if statements.
This was my first project so it is very basic, however, majority of this assignment was testing.
Writing good test cases is key to this assignment as I get more marks for tests and it will catch any
unexpected errors.
